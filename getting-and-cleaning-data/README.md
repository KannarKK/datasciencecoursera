#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Course link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning

##Background
Data Scientist is the sexiest job of this century. Wearable Computing, one of the areas of data science offers a lot of opportunities to look at Fitbit, Nike and Adidas wearable devices beyond their sale numbers and analyze the potential data generated through activity tracking and sports to draw out exciting insights. These insights can help both consumers as well as making efficient businesses with distinct competitive advantages. Therefore the data-driven approach to these devices' business creates an exciting area of data science called as Wearable Computing.

#Project 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

#Setup Instructions
(also mentioned in codebook)
Remember to set the working directory to the folder which contains the run_analysis.R script before its execution. For eg:
  setwd("D:/git/datasciencecoursera/getting-and-cleaning-data") 
Download the Data Set (link below) and add it to working directory  getting-and-cleaning-data/HARDataset

#End Result
1. [Input Data Set](https://github.com/KannarKK/datasciencecoursera/tree/master/getting-and-cleaning-data/HARDataset) The required unprocessed UCI Data Set
2. [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/KannarKK/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/getting-and-cleaning-data/CodeBook.md) describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
3. [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/KannarKK/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/getting-and-cleaning-data/run_analysis.R) my script for performing the analysis
4. [tidydataset.txt](https://github.com/KannarKK/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/getting-and-cleaning-data/tidydataset.txt) final tidy data set
